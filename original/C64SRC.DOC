  1. Introduction
  ---------------
    This package contains the assembly source files of two Commodore 64
    programs. They were transferred to PC system and converted to T64 tape file
    format. You can use C64ASM, the Commodore 64 (6510) Assembler Package for
    PC to compile the sources to executable C64 machine language programs.
    A C64 emulator (or a real C64) is required to run the compiled programs.

    The programs in this package are:
      - C64SRC  .DOC    This documentation
      - SPRD4ASM.T64    Assembly source of Bali's Sprite Designer 4.0
      - CHRE2ASM.T64    Assembly source of Bali's Character Editor 2.0
      - CHRE2BIN.PRG    Additional binary data for Bali's Character Editor 2.0
      - CHARSETS.T64    Two character sets for Bali's Character Editor 2.0
          - HUNGARIAN     - Hungarian characters
          - GREEK/MATH    - Greek letters and mathemathical symbols

    The source files are in original format, in order to demonstate how
    you can make C64ASM compile source files that were written originally for
    other compilers. You will need C64ASM v1.1 or later.
    I describe shortly the steps you must do in order to compile the files
    properly. See the documentation of C64ASM for further information on using
    C64ASM and the other utilities in that package.

    Of course, you may also use PROFI-ASS 64 on a C64 emulator or on a real C64
    to compile the sources. In this case no modification is needed, but you
    should load the sources from $2001 and not from $0801 in order to leave
    enough space for the compiled code as well.

    The compiled, executable version of these programs are also available
    under the name C64PROGS. The C64ASM mentioned above is also available
    as shareware. You can download them via World Wide Web at:
      http://indigo2.vsz.bme.hu/bali/download.htm

  2. Legal Notice
  ---------------
    This package is being distributed as FREEWARE. It means that you may use
    the programs free of charge.

    The program package, which MUST include all the above files may be freely
    copied and distributed. These files may be re-archived to better suit a
    given distribution system, but the distributed files may not be modified
    in any other way. No distributor may charge more than $5 for the
    distribution of this program. Uploading to BBSs or FTP sites or
    distribution on CD-ROMs are accepted and encouraged.

  3. How To Compile Bali's Sprite Designer 4.0
  --------------------------------------------
    The source of this program (SPRD4ASM.T64) contains two source files packed
    in one single T64 file.
    Carry out the following steps to compile the program:

    - Convert the sources to plain ascii files:
        BAS2TXT SPRD4ASM.T64 SPRITED4.ASM /LPS:
        BAS2TXT SPRD4ASM.T64 SD4PART2.ASM /LPS: /E=2
    - Edit SPRITED4.ASM:
        - Delete the first two lines (they were required by PROFI-ASS 64 only):
            SYS36864
            .OPT OO
        - Add the following line to the end of the file
            .INCLUDE SD4PART2.ASM
    - Edit SD4PART2.ASM:
        - Delete the first two lines (they were required by PROFI-ASS 64 only):
            SYS36864
            .OPT OO
    - Compile the source to T64 file (or to any other format):
        C64ASM SPRITED4 /SLT /6
    - Try out the compiled program (SPRITED4.T64):
         - Start a C64 emulator
         - Select SPRITED4.T64 in its file manager
         - Load the program (type: LOAD)
         - Start the program with the RUN command (a SYS command at the
             beginning of the file starts the machine language code)
    - You may delete the converted sources (SPRITED4.ASM and SD4PART2.ASM) and
        the reportfile (SPRITED4.REP)

  4. How To Compile Bali's Character Editor 2.0
  ---------------------------------------------
    The source of this program is in CHRE2ASM.T64.
    Additional binary data required for compiling (the program's character set
    and startup character set) can be found in CHRE2BIN.PRG. Two additional
    character sets that can be loaded by the compiled program are in
    CHARSETS.T64. The Hungarian character set is also put in the compiled
    program at startup. The other set contains Greek letters and mathemathical
    symbols.
    Carry out the following steps to compile the program:

    - Convert the source to plain ascii file:
        BAS2TXT CHRE2ASM.T64 CHREDIT2.ASM /LPS:
    - Edit CHREDIT2.ASM:
        - Delete the first two lines (they were required by PROFI-ASS 64 only):
            SYS36864
            .OPT OO
        - Add the following line to the end of the file
            .INCBIN CHRE2BIN.PRG
    - Compile the source to T64 file:
        C64ASM CHREDIT2 /SLT /6
    - Try out the compiled program (CHREDIT2.T64)
    - You may delete the converted source (CHREDIT2.ASM) and the reportfile
        (CHREDIT2.REP)
